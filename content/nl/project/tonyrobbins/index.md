This man makes me so inspired by his words, his actions, his view on life and how you can get the best out of yourself.

I have never been a fan of someone, for everything there has to be a first time :)

I did the UPW virtual in october 2020. I had a ticket for the live event in Birmingham and wil still be going for the live event, I have to feel the live energie with UPW and/or Date With Destiny.

Nice documentary about the 'Date with Destiny' experiance:
